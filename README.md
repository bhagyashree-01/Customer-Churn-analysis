# Customer-Churn and retention analysis
A churn and retention analysis report evaluates customer behavior to understand why customers leave or stay. It analyzes key factors such as tenure, usage frequency, support interactions, payment behavior, and subscription type to identify churn patterns, at-risk customers, and opportunities to improve retention through targeted actions.
Churn is the rate at which customers stop using a service, while retention measures how many customers continue using it.
Churn and retention analysis helps identify customer behavior patterns to reduce churn and improve customer loyalty.
